1) List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs
Ans:- 

	BrowserJS:-
i) Browser executes JS at the client side.
ii) "window" is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
iii) Browsers may have an object named "global", but it will be the exact one as "window".
iv) Browsers are not headless.
v) Browsers processes response objects.
vi) "location" is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.


	NodeJS
i) Node executes JS at the server side.
ii) Node doesn't have a predefined "window" object cause it doesn't have a window to draw anything.
iii) Node has "global", which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.
iv) Node is headless.
v) Node processes request object.
vi) "location" object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn't require that.
